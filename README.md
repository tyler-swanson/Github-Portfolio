## Home Credit Default Risk Assignment

### Business Problem:
People often have a difficult time when it comes to getting loans due to a lack of credit history. This
can lead to financial challenges and even result in loans being placed with unethical lenders. Home
Credit Group is looking to solve this issue by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience to
people that lack traditional credit history. One of Home Credit’s challenges is unlocking the full
potential of their data to ensure their current system for predicting who can repay loans is accurate.
Currently, some customers that should qualify for a loan are being wrongly rejected due to
limitations in Home Credit Group’s system.

### Benefit of a solution:
If Home Credit Group can enhance their prediction system to more accurately assess a customer’s
ability to repay loans, they will be able to offer ethical lending options to those in need. Unlocking
the full potential of their data will also ensure that the loan terms and conditions they provide will
empower their clients to be successful.

### Success Metrics:
1. Increase the rate of approved loans for customers that can repay. The more qualified clients
that work with Home Credit, the fewer loans that will be placed with unethical lenders.
2. Decrease loan default rates.
3. Provide clients with loan terms and conditions that will empower their success.

### Analytics Approach:
Use a supervised machine learning methods to improve Home Credit Group’s predictive power
when determining the binary target variable of repayment ability. Since the goal is to determine if a
client will be able to repay their loan or not, this is a classification problem of yes or no.

### Scope:
To goal of this project is to create a better model to predict if a client will be able to repay their loan
and to provide better information on loan terms that will empower their client’s success.
### Details:
This project will be completed by an individual MABA student over the 2024 Fall Semester. The
project will be finished before January 2025. Important milestones will be Data Understanding,
Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.
